## Description
Maths 101pong Epitech Teck1

Pong, an arcade game developped in 1972 by Ralph Baer (Atari), is the first ever successful video game. It
was inspired by the very first video game, Tennis for Two, developped in 1958 by William Higinbotham on
an oscilloscope.

The goal of this project is to work on a 3D version of this game (or of the Breakout game. . .). Only one paddle
will be considered, located in the (Oxy) plane (which is defined by the equation z = 0).

Your program must print:  
• The velocity vector of the ball,  
• The coordinates of the ball after a given amount of time,  
• The angle at which the ball will hit the paddle (if it will actually hit it, at anytime from t = 0).

| x0     | ball abscissa at time t - 1                         |
| y0     | ball ordinate at time t - 1                         |
| z0     | ball altitude at time t - 1                         |
| x1     | ball abscissa at time t                             |
| y1     | ball ordinate at time t                             |
| z1     | ball ordinate at time t                             |
| n      | time shift (greater than or equal to zero, integer) |
